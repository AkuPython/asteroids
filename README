# Asteroids boot.dev project

Classic asteroid game in PyGame.

Controls:
 - Up = Forward
 - Down = Backwards
 - Left = Rotate left
 - Right = Rotate right
 - Space Bar = Shoot


## boot.dev last note: Extending the Project

You've done all the required steps, but if you'd like to make the project your own, here are some ideas:

 - Add a scoring system
 - Implement multiple lives and respawning
 - Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
 - Add acceleration to the player movement
 - Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
 - Add a background image
 - Create different weapon types
 - Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
 - Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
 - Add a shield power-up
 - Add a speed power-up
 - Add bombs that can be dropped

=====================

## My thoughts had been:

 - Acceleration (game speed)
 - Screen wrap for player (not asteroids)
 - Change the asteroid split to consider shot projectile angle
